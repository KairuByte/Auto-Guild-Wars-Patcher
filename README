This is a placeholder readme

At the moment this project does not complete it's intended function. 
The mutex is removed without issue, however gw.dat remains locked. 
The code that attempts to remove the lock is currently disabled, due
to the fact that it causes the client to crash.

A complete rewrite is expected, however due to the methods employed
to achieve the end result, the source may or may not be released.

At the very least this code will remain available.

Some parts of the code came directly from Guild Wars Multi-Launch
which can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/gwmultilaunch/
Specifically most of the mutex/handle closer.
